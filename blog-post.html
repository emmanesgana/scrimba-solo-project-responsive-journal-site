            <h2 class="blog-post-title">My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-info">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made
                the big jump over to
                the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-info-title">How I stay committed to learning</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-info">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours
                learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing
                projects. </p>
            <p class="blog-post-info">
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about
                my journey with the world.
            </p>
            <h2 class="blog-post-info-title">How I got started</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-info">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes
                about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I
                learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-info">
                That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also
                helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
